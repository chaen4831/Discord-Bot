# Discord-Bot
Web Design and Development Final Project

Authors: Claire Haener-Pope, Brian Mutua, and Ryan Simmons
(Note: code was written through repl.it so while on GitHub, it may say Claire was the one to make updates, we all contributed to writing!)

Change the token in the 'config.json' file to that of the bot being used.

If running on repl.it, only run in shell and don't hit 'Run' to run the code in console. (That was why we had the issue of commands running twice)
